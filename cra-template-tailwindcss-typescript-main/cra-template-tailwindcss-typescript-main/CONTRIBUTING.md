# Contributing to cra-template-tailwindcss-typescript

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## Before you get started

First time contributing to an Open Source?  
Check out Kent C. Dodds's free EggHead course, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Did you find a bug?

**Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/dance2die/cra-template-tailwindcss-typescript/issues).

## Testing

I haven't set up an automatic steps. So you'd have to test manually by following [Testing a Template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/#testing-a-template) section in create-react-app documentation.

## Source code commit

This project has [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) to follow [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

So you'd have to install packages using `yarn` to install necessary packages.  
Husky pre-commit hit works "ok" on Windows, [but a bit buggy](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/issues/709) so be aware of it.
